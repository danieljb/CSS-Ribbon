# Minimal Markup CSS Ribbon #

This CSS renders a ribbon with minimal markup.

	<h1 class="ribbon">Hello ribbon</h1>

Thereâ€™s a css and a [less](http://lesscss.org/) version, as well as two corresponding html examples included.


### Disclaimer #

Please note: The CSS is mostly untested and might not be working in older browsers. It should degrade gracefully, though.
